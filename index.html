            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Originally founded as<em>“Florentina”</em> by the Romans, Florence rose to
wealth from its prominence among banking families like the Medici. From the 14th to the 16th centuries, its workshops and studios produced talent from top-tier artists like Brunelleschi, Donatello, and Michelangelo. This established the city as a beacon of art. </p>
